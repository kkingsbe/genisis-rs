## Notes

**Data Limitations:** The agent state files contain aggregated statistics rather than detailed execution history. As a result:
- Exact execution counts per time window are estimated based on lastRun timestamps
- Success/failure counts within specific windows cannot be precisely determined
- Work items processed are not tracked in state files
- Error counts reflect total cumulative errors, not window-specific errors

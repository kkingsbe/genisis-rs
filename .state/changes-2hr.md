## File Changes

### New/Modified Output Files
None found within this time window.

### Modified Workspace Files
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` (4 minutes ago)
- `TODO.md` (17 minutes ago)
- `COMPLETED.md` (26 minutes ago)
- `BACKLOG.md` (54 minutes ago)

## Notes

**Data Limitations:** The agent state files contain aggregated statistics rather than detailed execution history. As a result:
- Exact execution counts per time window are estimated based on lastRun, lastSuccess, and lastFailure timestamps
- Success/failure counts within specific windows are approximations
- Work items processed are not tracked in state files
- Error counts reflect total cumulative errors, not window-specific errors
- Some timestamps in state files show inconsistencies (e.g., lastFailure occurring after lastRun)

## Summary

During the 2-hour window (from 13:06:48 to 15:06:48 UTC), all three agents were active. The Prompt agent had 1 successful execution (87 minutes ago) among multiple runs, with 57 consecutive failures and 891 total errors. The Janitor agent achieved 1 success (125 minutes ago) among runs, with 26 consecutive failures and 211 total errors. The Architect agent performed better with 1 success (25 minutes ago) and 1 failure (47 minutes ago), with only 82 total errors.

Workspace modifications during this period included updates to ARCHITECTURE.md (4 minutes ago), TODO.md (17 minutes ago), COMPLETED.md (26 minutes ago), and BACKLOG.md (54 minutes ago), indicating active project management and development work.

The high number of consecutive failures for Prompt and Janitor agents (57 and 26 respectively) suggests ongoing issues with their execution environment or tasks.

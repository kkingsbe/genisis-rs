## Notes

**Data Limitations:** The agent state files contain aggregated statistics rather than detailed execution history. As a result:
- Exact execution counts per time window are estimated based on available timestamps
- Success/failure counts within specific windows are approximations
- Work items processed are not tracked in state files
- Error counts reflect total cumulative errors, not window-specific errors

## Summary

During the 6-hour window (from 09:29:46 to 15:29:46 UTC):
- **Prompt Agent**: Multiple executions with low success rate (<20%). High error count (907 cumulative) and 73 consecutive failures indicate persistent issues. 11 early terminations suggest recurring problems. Aggregate execution time ~13.8 hours.
- **Janitor Agent**: Multiple executions with low-moderate success rate (30-40%). 213 cumulative errors but currently running with 0 consecutive failures. 10 early terminations. Aggregate execution time ~11.4 hours.
- **Architect Agent**: Moderate success rate (~33-50%) with only 86 cumulative errors. Best performer among agents. Only 2 early terminations. Aggregate execution time ~8.9 hours.

**Workspace Activity**:
- Extensive documentation updates across ARCHITECTURE.md, COMPLETED.md, TODO.md, BACKLOG.md, LEARNINGS.md, BLOCKERS.md
- Active source code development in all four genesis crates (core, render, ui, physics)
- Significant communication activity in comms/archive/ with multiple Q&A and session summaries
- Report generation in reports/ directory including architect sessions and analysis reports
- State management activity with regular agent execution and state file updates

**Key Observations**:
1. The Prompt agent is the primary concern with 73 consecutive failures and 907 total errors
2. The Architect agent shows the most stable execution with balanced success/failure ratio
3. Workspace is actively maintained with comprehensive documentation tracking
4. Physics implementation progress: Friedmann equation and RK4 solver implemented in genesis-physics/cosmology/
5. Communication workflow is well-documented with archived sessions and reports

This 6-hour period shows intense development and maintenance activity across all aspects of the Genesis project, with agent execution issues being the primary concern.

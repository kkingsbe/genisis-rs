## Summary
All system activity is concentrated within the last 30 minutes of this 6-hour window. No agent activity, file modifications, or output generation occurred during the first 5.5 hours. All three agents executed in a burst of activity at the end of the window, with significant error counts for the Prompt and Janitor agents. The Architect agent is currently running. This pattern suggests either periodic scheduled tasks or a recently initiated intensive work session.

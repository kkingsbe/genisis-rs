## Notes

**Data Limitations:** The agent state files contain aggregated statistics rather than detailed execution history. As a result:
- Exact execution counts per time window are estimated based on earlyTerminationCount and timestamps
- Success/failure counts within specific windows are approximations
- Work items processed are not tracked in state files
- Error counts reflect total cumulative errors, not window-specific errors
- Some timestamps in state files show inconsistencies

**Execution Time Note:** The total execution times reported exceed the 6-hour window, indicating agents have been running cumulatively over longer periods or possibly in parallel/concurrent sessions.

## Summary

During the 6-hour window (from 09:06:48 to 15:06:48 UTC), all three agents were active. The Prompt agent shows the most activity with 11 early terminations and 57 consecutive failures, totaling 891 errors. The Janitor agent has 10 early terminations with 26 consecutive failures and 211 total errors. The Architect agent performed comparatively better with 2 early terminations, 82 total errors, and a current status of success.

Workspace activity was significant during this period, with 17 files modified including:
- Core project documentation: ARCHITECTURE.md, TODO.md, COMPLETED.md, BACKLOG.md, BLOCKERS.md, LEARNINGS.md
- Configuration: Cargo.toml
- Planning documents: architect-gap-analysis-2026-02-10-v2.md
- Communication archives: 10 different archived discussion files
- Reports: camera-interpolation-analysis-2026-02-10.md, orchestrator-session-2026-02-10.md

The high volume of communication archives and reports indicates active collaboration and decision-making during this window. The Prompt and Janitor agents' persistent failure patterns (57 and 26 consecutive failures respectively) suggest systemic issues requiring investigation.

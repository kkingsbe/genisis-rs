## Notes

**Data Limitations:** The agent state files contain aggregated statistics rather than detailed execution history. As a result:
- Exact execution counts per time window are estimated based on earlyTerminationCount and timestamps
- Success/failure counts within specific windows are approximations
- Work items processed are not tracked in state files
- Error counts reflect total cumulative errors, not window-specific errors
- Some timestamps in state files show inconsistencies (e.g., lastFailure occurring after current time)

**Execution Time Note:** The total execution times reported exceed the 24-hour window when summed (~34 hours aggregate), indicating agents have been running cumulatively over extended periods, potentially in parallel/concurrent sessions or across multiple days.

**Agent Performance Summary:**
- Prompt agent: 57 consecutive failures, 891 total errors - highest failure rate
- Janitor agent: 26 consecutive failures, 211 total errors - second highest failure rate
- Architect agent: 0 consecutive failures, 82 total errors - best performance among agents

## Summary

During the 24-hour window (from 15:06:48 on 2026-02-09 to 15:06:48 on 2026-02-10 UTC), significant agent activity occurred across all three agents. The Prompt agent shows the most concerning pattern with 11 early terminations, 0 successful terminations, 57 consecutive failures, and 891 total errors. The Janitor agent also struggles with 10 early terminations, 0 successful terminations, 26 consecutive failures, and 211 total errors. The Architect agent performs comparatively better with 2 early terminations, 0 successful terminations, 0 consecutive failures, 82 total errors, and a current status of success.

Workspace activity was extensive with 53 files modified within this window:

**Documentation updates included:**
- All core project files (ARCHITECTURE.md, TODO.md, COMPLETED.md, BACKLOG.md, BLOCKERS.md, LEARNINGS.md, PRD.md)
- Configuration files (Cargo.toml, genesis.toml)
- Planning documents (architect-gap-analysis-2026-02-10-v2.md)

**Communication archives (45 files):** Extensive documentation of project discussions, decisions, questions, and task decompositions, indicating active collaboration and ongoing work across multiple project phases including:
- Sprint planning and decisions
- Task decomposition for particle scaling, orbit pan, and GPU sync features
- Clarification of ambiguities across multiple phases
- Performance analysis and verification reports

**Reports (4 files):**
- Technical analysis (camera-interpolation-analysis-2026-02-10.md)
- Session summaries (orchestrator-session-2026-02-10.md, summary-architect-session-2026-02-09.html)
- Test reports (phase4-test-report-2026-02-09.md)

The high volume of modified files and communication archives demonstrates active development work throughout the 24-hour period, despite the agents' execution challenges. The persistent failure patterns for Prompt and Janitor agents require investigation to improve system reliability.

## Summary
The 24-hour period shows comprehensive system activity across all agents with 100% success rates. The Prompt and Architect agents achieved full success rates, while the Janitor agent also completed successfully. The Architect agent demonstrates the longest average execution time (179.45 minutes), suggesting it handles the most complex tasks. The cumulative error counts indicate ongoing challenges: Prompt agent (284 errors), Janitor agent (63 errors), and Architect agent (23 errors). The Prompt agent shows 7 early terminations suggesting lock acquisition issues, while the Janitor agent has 2 early terminations indicating potential cleanup process difficulties. Recent file modifications include project configuration (Cargo.toml), documentation (ARCHITECTURE.md, LEARNINGS.md), and project management files (TODO.md, COMPLETED.md, BACKLOG.md, BLOCKERS.md). The workspace files show consistent activity throughout the 24-hour period, with the oldest tracked file (Cargo.toml) being modified approximately 5 hours 37 minutes ago. This period represents sustained development activity with successful task execution across all agents.

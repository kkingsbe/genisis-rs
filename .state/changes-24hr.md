## Summary
All system activity for this 24-hour period is concentrated within the last 30 minutes. No agent activity, file modifications, or output generation occurred during the preceding 23.5 hours. This indicates either the system was idle, in maintenance mode, or the agents are configured to run on a schedule that has not been triggered. The recent burst of activity includes all three agents executing with high failure rates for Prompt (393 errors) and Janitor (88 errors) agents. The Architect agent is currently running. The lack of distributed activity suggests either a manual trigger of agents or a scheduled task that runs near the current time window.
